1. How to detect and test translation time processing errors.  JSP:SPEC:4 
assertion states that "Fatal translation failures shall result in the failure of 
subsequent client requests for the translation target with the appropriate error 
specification: For HTTP protocols the error status code 500 (Server Error) is 
returned."  Mark thinks it is important to verify that a container handles 
translation errors correctly.  After the meeting Mark proposed the following 
to jsr 152 expert group:
 
    To help strengthen the TCK for JSP 2.0, I'd like to make the following
    modification to JSP.1.4.1.  We want to be sure that a translation error
    is reliably detectable across all containers, otherwise tests that test
    for translation errors are difficult to write.

    I think the current spec is clear that a 500 is to be returned in the
    case of a translation error, but adding "In all cases" should firm
    things up a bit more:

    -----
    JSP.1.4.1

    "...In all cases, fatal translation failures shall result in the failure
    of subsequent client requests for the translation target with the
    appropriate error specification: For HTTP protocols the error status
    code 500 (Server Error) is returned."

2. JSP:SPEC:245 assertion states that "All JSP 2.0 containers must implement
JSR-045 by generating source map debugging information for JSP pages written
in either standard or XML syntax."  Currently this assertion is marked as 
untestable.  Mark says it will be removed from spec by the final release. 
This assertion will need to be marked as removed then.

3. Other Q&A's and editorial corrections.
