TCK Coverage Document for JSR-067 SOAP with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ) 1.3:


TCK Components:
---------------
- User's Guide
- Compatibility Rules
- Configuration Instructions
- Test Suite
- API Tests 
- Signature Test
- End-to-End Tests
- Framework Code
- JavaTest TM Harness


Terminology of Metrics
----------------------
- Assertion: A specific statement of functionality or behavior derived from a specification.
  A testable assertion is one that can be validated in an implementation by testing.
- Test: A binary application (or script) comprised of one or more Test Cases.
- Test Case: A single set of test inputs, execution conditions, and expected results
  developed to verify an implementation's conformance with a specific assertion.
- Specification Assertion Coverage: Ratio of all assertions tested by at least one test
  case to the total number of testable assertions defined by the specification.
- API Coverage: Ratio of methods directly exercised by test cases to the total number
  of methods defined by the specification.


Coverage
--------
- Total testable assertions: 22 specification assertions + 315 API assertions for a
                             total of 337 testable assertions
  Assertions identified through the use of CTS Tools and hand markup (hand markup was
  required for the SAAJ specification)
- Specification Tests tested: 20 (90.91%)
- API Tests tested: 293 (93.02%)
- API Signature Coverage: 100% for all defined public and protected members and validated
  by the signature test included with the SAAJ TCK.

Quality Assurance
-----------------

- The TCK tests were built and tested with the Java Web Services Developers Pack (JWSDP) 2.0 
  running on the JavaTM 2 Platform, Standard Edition SDK, Version 5.0

- The TCK was run using representative configurations of the Reference Implementation on
  the following platforms:
   * Solaris 9 Operating System on Sparc and x86
   * Solaris 10 Operating System on Sparc and Opteron
   * Windows 2003 Server Professional Edition
   * Windows XP Professional Edition
   * Windows 2000 Professional Edition
   * RedHat Linux 9.0
   * RedHat Linux AS 3.0 (including Update 4)
- Code quality was demonstrated through use of code reviews and inspections
- User's Guide was constructed from the J2EE CTS User's Guide template
- Documentation instructions were verified and tested


Justification of Adequacy
-------------------------
As the first major release of this specification, the coverage is good and consistent
with the coverage of similar JSRs at this level of spec maturity. Coverage variance
is due to effects of late spec changes and the availability/cost of test development
resources. Licensees are strongly encouraged to utilize the latest version of the
TCK when testing the compatibility of their SAAJ implementation, provided the TCK is
available, and the licensee chooses to use it, at the time of testing.
