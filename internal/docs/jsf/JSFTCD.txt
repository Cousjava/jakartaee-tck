TCK Coverage Document for JSR-372: JavaServer Faces 2.3 Specification

TCK Components:
---------------
- User's Guide
- Compatibility Rules
- Configuration Instructions
- Test Suite
- API Tests
- Signature Tests
- End-to-End Tests
- Framework Code
- JavaTest TM Harness

Terminology of Metrics
----------------------
- Assertion: A specific statement of functionality or behavior derived from a specification.
  A testable assertion is one that can be validated in an implementation by testing.
- Test: A binary application (or script) comprised of one or more Test Cases.
- Test Case: A single set of test inputs, execution conditions, and expected results
  developed to verify an implementation's conformance with a specific assertion.
- Specification Assertion Coverage: Ratio of all assertions tested by at least one test
  case to the total number of testable assertions defined by the specification.
- API Coverage: Ratio of methods directly exercised by test cases to the total number
  of methods defined by the specification.


Coverage
--------
- Total testable assertions from the JavaServer Faces 2.3 Specification,
  Tag Library Documentation, HTML Basic RenderKit Documentation, and Javadoc:

     746 specification assertions
    3320 tag library assertions (est.)
     700 renderkit assertions (est.)
  + 2808 API assertions
  ----------------------
    6503 testable assertions

- Number of testable JavaServer Faces Spec assertions tested:  469 (est.) (56.00%)
- Number of testable JSF Tag Library assertions tested:       2988 (est.) (90.03%)
- Number of testable JSF HTML Renderkit assertions tested:     567 (est.) (81.00%)
- Number of testable JavaServer Faces API assertions tested:  2330        (83.0%)

- Total of 77.5% combined specification, tag library, renderkit and api coverage.

Assertions were identified through the use of CTS Tools, third-party code
coverage tools, inspection of documentation and hand markup (hand markup was
required for the JavaServer Faces specifications).  Note that due to the
large number of assertions as well as resource and time constraints, it
was necessary in some cases to estimate the numbers of tested and total
assertions in each category.

Quality Assurance
-----------------
The JavaServer Faces requirements were tested as part of the JavaEE 7
Compatibility Test Suite which was run using representative configurations
of the Reference Implementation on the following platforms using Java SE 7:

   * Ubuntu 12.10
   * Fedora 18
   * openSUSE 12.2
   * Solaris 11.1 Sparc
   * Solaris 11.1 X86
   * Solaris 10 Sparc
   * MacOS 10.8
   * Oracle Linux Server release 6.3
   * Windows XP Professional
   * Windows 2008

- Code quality was demonstrated through the use of code reviews and inspections
- User's Guide was constructed from the standard CTS User's Guide template
- Documentation instructions were verified and tested


Justification of Adequacy
-------------------------
The JavaServer Faces tests, distributed as part of the JavaEE CTS version 7,
provide an adequate set of tests to ensure all implementations of the
Java EE 7 Platform are compatible with the requirements defined in these
specifications.  As with all TCKs it is impossible to provide tests
that will yield 100% assertion coverage. Untested assertions are due to the effects
of late specification changes, and the availability and cost of test development resources.
While these versions may not have tests for all testable assertions, all implementations of
the platform must be compatible with the requirements defined in these specifications.
