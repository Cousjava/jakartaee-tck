TCK Coverage Document for JSR-154 Java Servlet 2.5 Specification (Servlet):


TCK Components:
---------------
- User's Guide
- Compatibility Rules
- Configuration Instructions
- Test Suite
- API Tests 
- Signature Test
- End-to-End Tests
- Ant Task Tests
- Framework Code
- JavaTest TM Harness


Terminology of Metrics
----------------------
- Assertion: A specific statement of functionality or behavior derived from a specification.
  A testable assertion is one that can be validated in an implementation by testing.
- Test: A binary application (or script) comprised of one or more Test Cases.
- Test Case: A single set of test inputs, execution conditions, and expected results
  developed to verify an implementation's conformance with a specific assertion.
- Specification Assertion Coverage: Ratio of all assertions tested by at least one test
  case to the total number of testable assertions defined by the specification.
- API Coverage: Ratio of methods directly exercised by test cases to the total number
  of methods defined by the specification.


Coverage
--------
- Total testable assertions: 374 specification assertions + 223 API assertions for a
                             total of 597 testable assertions
  Assertions identified through the use of CTS Tools and hand markup (hand markup was
  required for the Servlet specification)
- Tests: 99
- API Signature Coverage: 100% for all defined public and protected members and validated
  by the signature test included with the Servlet TCK.
- See the following HTML reports in this bundle for Servlet specification and API coverage metrics:

    * coverage/servlet/spec/summary.html


Quality Assurance
-----------------
- TCK was run using representative configurations of the Reference Implementation on
  the following platforms:
   * Red Hat Linux/Sun J2SE 1.4.2
   * Windows XP/Sun J2SE 1.4.2
   * Solaris 8/Sun J2SE 1.4.2
- Code quality was demonstrated through use of code reviews and inspections
- User's Guide was constructed from the J2EE CTS User's Guide template
- Documentation instructions were verified and tested


Justification of Adequacy
-------------------------
As the first major release of this specification, the coverage is good and consistent
with the coverage of similar JSRs at this level of spec maturity. Coverage variance
is due to effects of late spec changes and the availability/cost of test development
resources. We plan to increase coverage over the next few months and release an updated
version of the TCK. Licensees are strongly encouraged to utilize the latest version of the
TCK when testing the compatibility of their Servlet implementation, provided the TCK is
available, and the licensee chooses to use it, at the time of testing.
