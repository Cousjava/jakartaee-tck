TCK Coverage Document for JSR-367 Java API for JSON Binding (JSON-B) 1.0 Specification


TCK Components:
---------------
- User's Guide
- Compatibility Rules
- Configuration Instructions
- Test Suite
- API Tests 
- Signature Tests
- Framework Code
- JavaTest TM Harness


Terminology of Metrics
----------------------
- Assertion: A specific statement of functionality or behavior derived from a
  specification. A testable assertion is one that can be validated in an
  implementation by testing.
- Test: A binary application (or script) comprised of one or more Test Cases.
- Test Case: A single set of test inputs, execution conditions, and expected
  results developed to verify an implementation's conformance with a specific
  assertion.
- Specification Assertion Coverage: Ratio of all assertions tested by at least
  one test case to the total number of testable assertions defined by the
  specification.
- API Coverage: Ratio of methods directly exercised by test cases to the total
  number of methods defined by the specification.

Assertion details.  These details will be removed from the final TCD but are
checked into revision history so we can backtrack the numbers later, if we need to.

Assertions found by the coverage tools (May 10th, 2017 coverage report):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  api testable total    :  66
  api tested total 		  :  66
  api percentage tested	:  100%
  spec testable total   :  141
  spec tested total 		:  138
  spec percentage tested:  97.87%

Number of tests in JSON-B TCK: 271


Quality Assurance
-----------------
- TCK was run on the following platforms, note all platforms use Java Platform, Standard Edition 8
  (Java SE 8):
   * Oracle Linux 7.1
   * Windows 10 

- Code quality was demonstrated through the use of code reviews and inspections
- User's Guide was constructed from the standard TCK User's Guide template
- Documentation instructions were verified and tested


Justification of Adequacy
-------------------------
The JSON-B TCK Version 1.0 provides a comprehensive set of tests to ensure that all
implementations of the Java API for JSON Binding 1.0 Specification are compatible. As 
with all TCKs it is impossible to provide tests for 100% assertion coverage. Note, 
while the TCK may not have tests for all assertions in the Java API for JSON Binding
1.0 Specification, all implementations must be compatible with the specification.

Untested assertions are due to the effects of late specification changes, optional
functionality, conditions that cannot be easily tested, and the availability and 
cost of test development resources.
