TCK Coverage Document for JSR-250 Common Annotations for the Java Platform


TCK Components:
---------------
- User's Guide
- Compatibility Rules
- Configuration Instructions
- Test Suite
- Signature Test
- Framework Code
- JavaTest TM Harness


Terminology of Metrics
----------------------
- Assertion: A specific statement of functionality or behavior derived from a specification.
  A testable assertion is one that can be validated in an implementation by testing.
- Test: A binary application (or script) comprised of one or more Test Cases.
- Test Case: A single set of test inputs, execution conditions, and expected results
  developed to verify an implementation's conformance with a specific assertion.
- API Coverage: Ratio of methods directly exercised by test cases to the total number
  of methods defined by the specification.


Coverage
--------
- API Signature Coverage: 100% for all defined public and protected members and validated
  by the signature test included with the CAJ TCK.


Quality Assurance
-----------------

- The TCK tests were built and tested on the Java Platform, Standard Edition 8 (Java SE 8)
- Code quality was demonstrated through use of code reviews and inspections
- User's Guide was constructed from the J2EE CTS User's Guide template
- Documentation instructions were verified and tested


Justification of Adequacy
-------------------------
As the first major release of this specification, the coverage is good and consistent
with the coverage of similar JSRs at this level of spec maturity. Licensees are strongly 
encouraged to utilize the latest version of the TCK when testing the compatibility of 
their CAJ implementation, provided the TCK is available, and the licensee chooses to use 
it, at the time of testing.
