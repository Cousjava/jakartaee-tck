This README file describes how the rmiiiop tests work.

(1) The rmiiiop marshaltests tests verify rmiiiop functionality
    from all J2EE containers by communicating with an rmiiiop ejb.
    All legal rmiiiop types as specified in the Java-To-IDL Mapping
    Specification are transmitted back and forth to/from J2EE clients
    to/from rmiiiop server ejb and all the data is verified.

    rmiiiop marshaltests appclient     ===> rmiiiop ejb
    rmiiiop marshaltests ejbclient     ===> rmiiiop ejb
    rmiiiop marshaltests jspclient     ===> rmiiiop ejb
    rmiiiop marshaltests servletclient ===> rmiiiop ejb

(2) The rmiiiop standalone tests verify rmiiiop functionality from
    all J2EE containers by communicating with an external rmiiiop 
    server application. All legal rmiiiop types as specified in 
    the Java-To-IDL Mapping Specification are transmitted back and 
    forth to/from J2EE clients to/from standalone rmiiiop server
    application and all the data is verified.

    rmiiiop standalone appclient     ===> rmiiiop server application
    rmiiiop standalone ejbclient     ===> rmiiiop server application
    rmiiiop standalone jspclient     ===> rmiiiop server application
    rmiiiop standalone servletclient ===> rmiiiop server application

    These tests require you to start the standalone rmiiiop server
    application via the "tsant start.rmiiiop.server" ant task. See
    the CTS Users Guide referring to the rmiiiop standalone tests
    setup instructions.

(3) The rmiiiop objecttests tests verify passing/returning rmiiiop
    type objects to/from a J2EE appclient to/from an rmiiiop ejb
    and then verifies invoking methods on these rmiiiop objects. It 
    also verifies passing/returning EJBHome objects and EJBObject 
    objects to/from rmiiiop type objects.

    rmiiiop objecttests appclient ===> rmiiiop ejb

(4) The rmiiiop orbtests tests verify creating an ORB instance using
    "ORB.init(new String[0], null)" or looking up an ORB instance from
    the JNDI namespace under the name "java:comp/ORB". After creating
    or looking up an ORB instance the tests verify that the ORB instance
    can be used from within the J2EE containers. Some basic ORB 
    functionality is exercised in particular "ORB.string_to_object()"
    is tested. The appclient, ejb, and web containers are tested.

    rmiiiop orbtests from appclient are verified
    rmiiiop orbtests from ejb are verified
    rmiiiop orbtests from servlet are verified

(5) All stubs and ties for standalone rmiiiop objects and standalone
    javaidl objects are POA based stubs and ties.
