This README file describes how the rmiiiop standalone tests work.
The rmiiiop standalone tests contain the following 4 "ear" files:

o rmiiiop_standalone_appclient_vehicle.ear
o rmiiiop_standalone_ejb_vehicle.ear
o rmiiiop_standalone_jsp_vehicle.ear
o rmiiiop_standalone_servlet_vehicle.ear

The rmiiiop standalone tests also contain a standalone RMIIIOP
Server Application:

o RMIIIOPServer

The rmiiiop standalone tests consists of the J2EE client tests
which runs in all the J2EE containers of (appclient, ejb, jsp,
and servlet) and which communicate with the standalone RMIIIOP
Server Application which runs as a separate java application
outside the J2EE server environment.

The J2EE client tests create a HTTP URL connection to the standalone
RMIIIOP Server Application, read the IOR of the RMIIIOP Server Object
from the URL connection, create an ORB instance via a "ORB.init()",
convert the IOR of the RMIIIOP Server Object to a CORBA object, and 
then narrow the CORBA object to get actual the object reference. Now 
the J2EE clients can communicate with a standalone RMIIIOP Server 
Object. The HTTP URL is at:

http://${RMIIIOP_HTTP_SERVER_HOST}:${RMIIIOP_HTTP_SERVER_PORT}

So to run this test you must do the following:

(1) Start the standalone RMIIIOP Server Application.

	% cd $TS_HOME/bin
	% tsant start.rmiiiop.server

(2) Start J2EE server.

	% j2ee -verbose

(3) Deploy and Run the rmiiiop standalone tests.

	% cd $TS_HOME/tests/rmiiiop/standalone
	% tsant runclient
