Top level README file for TS Interoperability Tests.

TS interoperability testing is performed using two different J2EE 
Server Implementations. One implementation being the Sun J2EE 
Reference Implementation (RI) and the other being the Vendor J2EE 
Implementation (VI). TS interoperability testing is performed
in both directions as follows:

(1) Vendor J2EE Implementation #1 ==> Sun J2EE Reference Implementation #2

(2) Sun J2EE Reference Implementation #1 ==> Vendor J2EE Implementation #2

The TS test harness automatically handles running the interoperability 
tests in both directions.

Please refer to the TS Users Guide for the complete instructions for 
performing TS interoperability testing.

The TS interoperability test directories are:

o tests/interop/rmiiiop
o tests/interop/ejb
o tests/interop/security
o tests/interop/integration
o tests/interop/tx
o tests/interop/csiv2
o tests/interop/saaj

All test directories have README files describing the interoperability
tests at that directory level.

How are the ear files deployed to the two J2EE Server Implementations.
All ear files ending in "_j2ee2.ear" get deployed to J2EE Server #2 
and all the other ear files get deployed to J2EE Server #1.

The TS Interoperability Tests exercise the six main areas of EJB 
Interoperability and WebServices Interoperability namely:

	a) Remote Method Invocation (EJB Invocation) Interoperability
	b) Transaction Interoperability
	c) Naming Interoperability
	d) Security Interoperability
	e) RMI over IIOP Interoperability
	f) Common Secure Interoperability v2 (IIOP-level)
	g) SAAJ Interoperability

	All EJB interoperability is based on the industry standard CORBA
	IIOP protocol. All J2EE containers must support GIOP1.2 as the
	interoperability protocol. All EJB invocations must be invoked
	over the GIOP1.2 protocol.

	All security interoperability is based on the (CSIv2) Corba Secure 
	Interoperability Version 2 Specification.

	All naming interoperability is based on the Corba CosNaming Naming
	Service and the (INS) Interoperable Naming Service Specification.

	All transaction interoperability is based on the (OTS1.2) Corba 
	Object Transaction Service Specification.

	All rmiiiop interoperability is based on the IIOP protocol namely
	GIOP1.2 and the Java-To-IDL Mapping Specification which describes 
	the subset of RMI that is mapped to RMI/IDL and can be transmitted 
	over IIOP. All legal rmiiiop types are transmitted back and forth
	across a remote interface.

Again for more information on interoperability testing please refer to the 
TS Users Guide and the EJB2.0 Specification (Chapter 19).
