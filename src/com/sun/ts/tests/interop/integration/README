This README file describes how the integration interoperability tests 
work. The integration interoperability tests contain the following 4 
"ear" files:

o interop_integration_jspejbjdbc.ear
o interop_integration_jspejbjdbc_tellerbean_j2ee2.ear

o interop_integration_servletejbjdbc.ear
o interop_integration_servletejbjdbc_tellerbean_j2ee2.ear

The integration interoperability tests consists of the client-side
tests which runs in the jsp or servlet web containers of J2EE Server
#1 and the server-side tests which is the tellerbean ejb which runs 
in the ejb container of J2EE Server #2.

EJB 2.0 Specification (Chapter 19) Support For Interoperability

----------------------------------
jspejbjdbc
jsp to ejb to jdbc end-to-end test
----------------------------------
1) Deploys the ejb to J2EE Server #2.  
   Deploys the ear "interop_integration_jspejbjdbc_tellerbean_j2ee2.ear"
   to J2EE Server #2.
2) Deploys the jsp to J2EE Server #1.
   Deploys the ear "interop_integration_jspejbjdbc.ear" to J2EE Server #1.
3) Runs the jsp to ejb to jdbc integration interoperability tests.
4) The jsp deployed in J2EE Server #1 looks up the ejb deployed
   in J2EE Server #2 and invokes its buisness methods to run the
   integration interoperability tests. This verifies jsp to ejb
   interoperability between 2 J2EE Servers.
5) Verifies that a jsp deployed in one J2EE Server can communicate
   with an ejb deployed in another J2EE Server.
6) All tests should PASS.

--------------------------------------
servletejbjdbc
servlet to ejb to jdbc end-to-end test
--------------------------------------
1) Deploys the ejb to J2EE Server #2.
   Deploys the ear "interop_integration_servletejbjdbc_tellerbean_j2ee2.ear"
   to J2EE Server #2.
2) Deploys the servlet to J2EE Server #1.
   Deploys the ear "interop_integration_servletejbjdbc.ear" to J2EE Server #1.
3) Runs the servlet to ejb to jdbc integration interoperability tests.
4) The servlet deployed in J2EE Server #1 looks up the ejb deployed
   in J2EE Server #2 and invokes its buisness methods to run the
   integration interoperability tests. This verifies servlet to ejb
   interoperability between 2 J2EE Servers.
5) Verifies that a servlet deployed in one J2EE Server can communicate
   with an ejb deployed in another J2EE Server.
6) All tests should PASS.
