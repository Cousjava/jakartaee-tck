This README file describes how the ejb interoperability tests work.

The ejb interoperability tests consists of the client-side tests
which runs in the appclient container of J2EE Server #1 and the 
server-side tests which run in the ejb container of J2EE Server #2.
These tests verifies appclient to ejb interoperability across two
J2EE Servers.

For the bean2beanmultijartest the client-side tests runs in the
appclient and ejb containers of J2EE Server #1. The appclient calls
the client ejb which in turn calls the server-side tests which run in
the ejb container of J2EE Server #2. This test verifies client ejb 
to server ejb interoperability across two J2EE Servers.

The following tests exist:

o ejb/session/stateful/clientviewtest
o ejb/session/stateful/exceptionerrortest
o ejb/session/stateful/handletest
o ejb/session/stateful/bean2beanmultijartest
o ejb/session/stateless/clientviewtest

o ejb/entity/bmp/clientviewtest
o ejb/entity/cmp/clientviewtest

clientviewtest (stateful)
appclient to ejb to end-to-end test
----------------------------------
1) Deploys the ejb to J2EE Server #2. Deploys the ear
   "interop_ejb_Ssf_clientviewtest_j2ee2.ear" to J2EE Server #2.
2) Deploys the appclient to J2EE Server #1. Deploys the ear
   "interop_ejb_Ssf_clientviewtest.ear" to J2EE Server #1.
