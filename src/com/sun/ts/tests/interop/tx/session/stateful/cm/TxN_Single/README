Container Managed Transaction tests for a single table.

Specification assertion under test: 
	11.6.2.6 Container Managed Transactions - Never 

The assertion:
The Container invokes an EJB method whose transaction attribute is set
to Never as follows:

	The Container must invoke an EJB method whose transaction 
	attribute is set ot Never in a global transaction context.
	The client is required to call without a transaction context.

	If the client calls without a transaction context, the
	Container performs the same steps as described in the
	NotSupported case.  Which are:

	If the EJB's method accesses resources, the access to each
	resource is performed in a local transaction.
	When the business method completes, the Container
	automatically commits the work on all the resource managers
	that have been used by the business methods.

Test Case(s):
These tests ensure that the Container provides the transaction
demarcation for the EJBs which are declared as using container
managed demarcation. The responsibilities for the Container are
described in section 11.6.2 of the Moscone specification.

Single table/single connection cases include:
        Perform Insert/Delete operations to a single table and ensure
        that these operations are commited automatically after each
        method completes.

The test itself is made up of:
1 Client
1 TestTean, this bean:
	o	drives the tests and is TX_BEAN_MANAGED 
	o	acts as a client to the JDBC transactional bean (TxBean).
1 TxBean, this bean:
	o	is the JDBC transactional bean and is called by TestBean.
